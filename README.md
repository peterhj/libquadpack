# libquadpack

This library is a wrapper around QUADPACK, the venerable Fortran 77 numerical
integration code.

This uses the SLATEC flavor of QUADPACK (http://www.netlib.org/slatec/),
which seems to be more up-to-date than the standalone library
(http://www.netlib.org/quadpack/), and is also unambiguously in the public
domain.
